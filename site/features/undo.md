# Undo and Redo

Observant provides built-in undo and redo functionality, allowing you to track changes to your data and revert them if needed. This page explains how the undo/redo system works in Observant.

## Overview

The undo/redo system in Observant is field-based, meaning you can undo changes to individual fields independently. This gives you fine-grained control over which changes to revert.

Key features of the undo/redo system:

- Per-field undo/redo
- Configurable undo stack size
- Debounce support for rapid changes
- Integration with validation and dirty tracking

## Enabling Undo

To enable undo functionality, you can either:

1. Enable it globally when creating the proxy
2. Enable it for specific fields after creating the proxy

### Global Undo

To enable undo globally, set `undo=True` when creating the proxy:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from observant import ObservableProxy

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    age: int

user = User(name="Alice", age=30)
proxy = ObservableProxy(user, undo=True)  # Enable undo for all fields
```

### Per-Field Undo

To enable undo for specific fields, use the `set_undo_config` method:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from observant import ObservableProxy

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str

user = User(name="Alice", age=30, email="alice@example.com")
proxy = ObservableProxy(user)  # Undo disabled by default

# Enable undo for specific fields
proxy.set_undo_config("name", enabled=True)
proxy.set_undo_config("age", enabled=True)
# email field will not have undo enabled
```

## Undo Configuration

The undo system can be configured with several options:

- `enabled`: Whether undo is enabled for a field
- `undo_max`: Maximum number of undo steps to store
- `undo_debounce_ms`: Time in milliseconds to wait before recording a new undo step

### undo_max

The `undo_max` option limits the number of undo steps that are stored for a field. This prevents the undo stack from growing too large and consuming too much memory.

```python
# Limit to 10 undo steps
proxy.set_undo_config("name", enabled=True, undo_max=10)
```

### undo_debounce_ms

The `undo_debounce_ms` option adds debounce behavior to the undo system. If multiple changes are made to a field within the debounce time, only the last change is recorded as an undo step.

This is useful for fields that change rapidly, such as text fields during typing:

```python
# Debounce undo steps by 500ms
proxy.set_undo_config("name", enabled=True, undo_debounce_ms=500)

# These rapid changes will be combined into a single undo step
name_obs = proxy.observable(str, "name")
name_obs.set("A")
name_obs.set("Al")
name_obs.set("Ali")
name_obs.set("Alic")
name_obs.set("Alice")

# Only one undo step is created
proxy.undo("name")  # Reverts directly to the original value
```

## Undo/Redo API

Once undo is enabled, you can use the following methods to undo and redo changes:

- `undo(field)`: Undo the last change to a field
- `redo(field)`: Redo the last undone change to a field
- `can_undo(field)`: Check if there are any undo steps available for a field
- `can_redo(field)`: Check if there are any redo steps available for a field

### Basic Undo/Redo

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from observant import ObservableProxy

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    age: int

user = User(name="Alice", age=30)
proxy = ObservableProxy(user, undo=True)

# Make some changes
name_obs = proxy.observable(str, "name")
age_obs = proxy.observable(int, "age")
name_obs.set("Bob")
age_obs.set(25)

# Undo changes
proxy.undo("name")  # Reverts name to "Alice"
proxy.undo("age")   # Reverts age to 30

# Redo changes
proxy.redo("name")  # Sets name back to "Bob"
proxy.redo("age")   # Sets age back to 25
```

### Checking Undo/Redo Availability

You can check if undo or redo is available for a field using the `can_undo` and `can_redo` methods:

```python
# Check if undo is available
if proxy.can_undo("name").get():
    proxy.undo("name")

# Check if redo is available
if proxy.can_redo("name").get():
    proxy.redo("name")
```

These methods return observables, so you can also listen for changes:

```python
# Listen for changes to undo availability
proxy.can_undo("name").on_change(lambda can_undo: 
    print(f"Undo available for name: {can_undo}"))

# Listen for changes to redo availability
proxy.can_redo("name").on_change(lambda can_redo: 
    print(f"Redo available for name: {can_redo}"))
```

## Per-Field vs Global Undo

> **Important**: Observant's undo system is field-based, not transaction-based. Each field has its own independent undo stack. There is no concept of a "global undo" that reverts multiple fields at once as a single transaction.

Observant's field-based undo system allows you to undo changes to one field without affecting others:

```python
# Make changes to multiple fields
name_obs = proxy.observable(str, "name")
age_obs = proxy.observable(int, "age")
name_obs.set("Bob")
age_obs.set(25)

# Undo only the name change
proxy.undo("name")  # Reverts name to "Alice"

# Age remains changed
print(age_obs.get())  # 25
```

This field-based approach gives you more control over which changes to undo, but it also means you need to undo each field separately if you want to undo all changes.

### Batch Undo Helper

If you need to undo all changes at once, you can create a helper function:

```python
def undo_all(proxy, fields):
    """Undo all fields that have undo steps available."""
    for field in fields:
        if proxy.can_undo(field).get():
            proxy.undo(field)

# Usage:
undo_all(proxy, ["name", "age", "email"])
```

You can extend this pattern for more complex undo scenarios:

```python
def undo_to_clean_state(proxy, fields):
    """Undo all fields until none are dirty."""
    while proxy.is_dirty().get():
        for field in fields:
            if proxy.is_field_dirty(field).get() and proxy.can_undo(field).get():
                proxy.undo(field)
        # Break if we can't undo any more dirty fields
        if all(not proxy.can_undo(field).get() for field in fields if proxy.is_field_dirty(field).get()):
            break
```

## Limitations and Gotchas

### Sync and Undo

The `sync` and `undo` options can be used together, but this can lead to unexpected behavior. When `sync=True`, changes are immediately applied to the underlying model, which means that undo operations will not affect the model until you call `save_to`.

```python
user = User(name="Alice", age=30)
proxy = ObservableProxy(user, sync=True, undo=True)

# Make a change
name_obs = proxy.observable(str, "name")
name_obs.set("Bob")
print(user.name)  # "Bob" (sync=True applies changes immediately)

# Undo the change
proxy.undo("name")
print(name_obs.get())  # "Alice"
print(user.name)  # Still "Bob" until save_to is called

# Save changes back to the model
proxy.save_to(user)
print(user.name)  # Now "Alice"
```

For this reason, it's generally recommended to use `sync=False` when using undo functionality.

### Collection Fields

For list and dictionary fields, undo/redo works on the entire collection, not individual elements. This means that if you make multiple changes to a collection, undoing will revert all of those changes at once.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from observant import ObservableProxy

@dataclass
class TodoList:
    tasks: list[str]

todo_list = TodoList(tasks=["Buy milk"])
proxy = ObservableProxy(todo_list, undo=True)

# Get the observable list
tasks = proxy.observable_list(str, "tasks")

# Make multiple changes
tasks.append("Write docs")
tasks.append("Fix bugs")
tasks.remove("Buy milk")

# Undo all changes at once
proxy.undo("tasks")  # Reverts to ["Buy milk"]
```

### Computed Fields

Computed fields are not directly undoable, since their values are derived from other fields. However, when you undo changes to a field that a computed field depends on, the computed field will update accordingly.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from observant import ObservableProxy

@dataclass
class User:
    first_name: str
    last_name: str

user = User(first_name="Alice", last_name="Smith")
proxy = ObservableProxy(user, undo=True)

# Register a computed property
proxy.register_computed(
    "full_name",
    lambda: f"{proxy.observable(str, 'first_name').get()} {proxy.observable(str, 'last_name').get()}",
    dependencies=["first_name", "last_name"]
)

# Make a change
first_name_obs = proxy.observable(str, "first_name")
first_name_obs.set("Bob")
print(proxy.computed(str, "full_name").get())  # "Bob Smith"

# Undo the change
proxy.undo("first_name")
print(proxy.computed(str, "full_name").get())  # "Alice Smith"
```

### Validation and Undo

When you undo a change, validation is automatically re-run for the affected field. This means that if you undo a change that makes a field invalid, the validation errors will be updated accordingly.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from observant import ObservableProxy

@dataclass
class User:
    username: str

user = User(username="")
proxy = ObservableProxy(user, undo=True)

# Add a validator
proxy.add_validator("username", lambda v: "Username required" if not v else None)

# Set a valid value
username_obs = proxy.observable(str, "username")
username_obs.set("alice")
print(proxy.is_valid().get())  # True

# Undo the change
proxy.undo("username")
print(proxy.is_valid().get())  # False
print(proxy.validation_for("username").get())  # ["Username required"]
```
